# Fog

When analysing ERA5 climatological data, fog is not well addressed as a parameter.
Dorman et al. (2017) interpret ICOADS (International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set) 
to provide an analysis of the frequency of WW 40 - 49 IMO weather codes for each 1 degree lat & lon grid cell in areas with the highest prevalence of fog.
and > 100 meteorological observations.
However the results are presented on a seasonal frequency rather than monthly and numerical data for this presentation is not readily available, 
so a new analysis of the ICOADS data has been carried out here.

Global fog and mist data is downloaded from the ICOADS database. It is then filtered by lat, lon and month/season. 
The length of each filtered lat/lon/month/season sub-category is recored in a frequency tally chart.
The tally chart is converted into the percentage of observations having that fog/mist phenomena and also summarised.
