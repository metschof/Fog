# Fog

When analysing ERA5 climatological data, fog is not well addressed as a parameter.
Dorman et al. (2017) interpret ICOADS (International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set) 
to provide an analysis of the frequency of WW 40 - 49 IMO weather codes for each 1 degree lat & lon grid cell in areas with the highest prevalence of fog.
However the results are presented on a seasonal frequency rather than monthly and numerical data for this presentation is not readily available, 
so a new analysis of the ICOADS data has been carried out here.

Initial analysis for the North Atlantic Region 45N to 70N, 34W to 20E has been undertaken
